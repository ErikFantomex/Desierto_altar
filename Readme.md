# CamellÃ³n botanico  Project

## Overview
The PanteÃ³n Memorial Project, initiated in 2019, is an ambitious initiative to transform 22 hectares into an urban natural sanctuary. Nestled within the city, this green lung offers 10 kilometers of trails amidst 500 planted trees, inviting the community to reconnect with nature. Our weekly irrigation activities underscore our dedication to sustainability and the nurturing of this vital space.

## Upcoming Medium Article
Join us in our upcoming Medium post where we dive into the enthralling realm of web cartography. Discover how this technology enhances the visibility and impact of conservation projects.

## Technologies
Our journey will introduce you to **Leaflet**, a JavaScript library that brings elegant and efficient web mapping solutions to digital platforms. Alongside **pynaturalist**, which enables us to engage with biodiversity observations, we will leverage **GeoDjango** and **Django REST** frameworks for seamless management and presentation of geospatial data. The integration of **PostGIS**, an advanced geographic database system, completes our toolkit.

Stay tuned for an insightful exploration of these technologies that power our web dashboard, serving as both an educational portal and conservation tool.
